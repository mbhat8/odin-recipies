    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chitranna (Kannada: ಚಿತ್ರಾನ್ನ; also known as lemon-rice) is a rice-based dish widely prepared in South India. It is prepared by mixing cooked rice with a special seasoning called Oggarane or Gojju. Characteristic for the seasoning are mustard seeds, fried lentils, peanuts, curry leaves, chillies, lemon juice and other optional items such as scrapes of unripe mango. Added Turmeric powder gives Chitranna its yellow color. Garlic and onions are also used in the seasoning by some, although traditionally they do not form part of the recipe. The dish is especially popular in the south Indian state of Karnataka, where it has become a part of the daily diet.</p>
